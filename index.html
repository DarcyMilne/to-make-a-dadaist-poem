    <h1>To Make a Dadaist Poem</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Take a newspaper.</li>
      <li>Take a pair of scissors.</li>
      <li>Choose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.</li>
      <li>Cut out the article.</li>
      <li>
        Then cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them in
        a bag.
      </li>
      <li>Shake it gently.</li>
      <li>
        Then take out the scraps one after the other in the order in which they
        left the bag.
      </li>
      <li>Copy conscientiously.</li>
      <li>The poem will be like you.</li>
      <li>
        And here are you a writer, infinitely original and endowed with a
        sensibility that is charming though beyond the understanding of the
        vulgar.
      </li>

      const article = `In November, when Pauline Chalamet debuted in The Sex Lives of College Girls as Kimberly, many viewers were surprised to learn that Timothée Chalamet had an older sister, let alone one who acts. Although Pauline had made her feature film debut alongside Pete Davidson in Judd Apatow’s comedy The King of Staten Island a year before, it was her leading role in the HBO Max comedy-drama series that served as her big break. Pauline’s humorous performance as a dorky, sheltered, school-loving college student was sweet and tender and with the show having just been renewed for a new season, it also solidified the Chalamet siblings’ standing as a force to be reckoned with. Such is the cultural positioning of the Chalamets, that when I meet their mother, Nicole Flender, on a gray Tuesday afternoon at The Drama Bookshop in Manhattan, we lower our voices when mentioning Timothée to avoid being overheard by anyone shopping in the bookstore. I can see aspects of Timothée and Pauline in Flender – all three have petite noses and that same angular, youthful smile. But Flender has done a good job at being relatively unaffected by the fame of her children. “I’m happy that they’re successful and safe and healthy, and I would feel that way no matter what their profession was,” she tells me. As she passes along her vaccination card to a sales associate, no one assumes she is the mother of two successful actors, one rising, and the other Oscar-nominated.`;
